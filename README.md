### Technical interview resources
This repo has a list of websites, blog posts, book suggestions and coding websites to help software engineers to prepare for technical interviews.

Feel free to fork it and add new content that you find helpful!


##### Coding preps

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/): My favorite website to practice different types of coding challenges. Supports several types of coding languages and is constantly being updated.

*LeetCode OJ is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews. Pick from an expanding library of more than 190 questions, code and submit your solution to see if you have solved it correctly.*

- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/): Series of really interesting mathematical problems to help you practice your coding skills.

- [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com/): Coding challenges.

##### Books

-  [Cracking the Code Interview](https://www.careercup.com/book): Cool book with tips on how to approach technical interviews for software engineers with theoretical explanations on algorithms, data structures and design patterns. The book also has a bunch of interview questions with solutions, based on real interview cases.
- [Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8): A great book on design patterns. The content might not even be touched during interviews, but it's a really interesting book nevertheless.

#### Other sites

[CareerCup](https://www.careercup.com/): A bunch of interview questions and tips from other applicants. From the same author of the book Cracking the Code Interview mentioned above.

[Glassdoor interviews](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/index.htm): Learn more about the company's interview process based on other people's reviews.y

#### Other resource bundles

It might look too much stuff to prepare, but chances are that you will barely talk about what's listed above. So don't panic, have fun during the interviews and don't be afraid to say that you don't know an answer. Always think out loud and don't be shy to discuss with the person on the other side. The interviews should be a two way accessement: don't forget that potentially you'll end up working with the person on the other side of the table.
